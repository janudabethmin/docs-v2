# Create a VPC

This guide outlines the steps to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS using the SkyU Platform.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the `Infrastructure` feature is enabled for your project. If not, refer to the [Enable Infrastructure as Code](/docs/infrastructure/enable-iac) guide.

---

## Steps to Create a VPC

<Steps>

### Select the Template

1. Navigate to the `Infrastructure` tab in the left sidebar of the SkyU Console.
2. Click `Create Infrastructure` to access customizable infrastructure templates.
3. Select the `AWS VPC` template.

---

### Create the IAM Role

1. After selecting the template, click `Launch`.
2. Provide details for: **Name**, **Description** and **Region**.

3. Click `Generate ARN` to create the role on AWS. You’ll be redirected to the AWS console. Fill in the required fields and click `Create Stack`.

   <Callout type="info">
   Ensure you are logged into the AWS Management Console in the same browser as the SkyU console before clicking **Generate ARN**.
   </Callout>

4. Copy the generated Role ARN from the outputs section of the CloudFormation stack.

6. Click `Next` to proceed.

### Configure Template Parameters

1. If you haven’t created an **Infra Cost API Credential**, do so now. Otherwise, use an existing credential.

2. Fill in the required template parameters to define your VPC configuration.

3. Click `Request Review` to proceed.

### Review and Approve the Plan

1. Wait for the infrastructure planning process to complete.

   <Callout type="info">
   The planning process may take some time. Please be patient.
   </Callout>

2. Review the plan and its associated graph. To make changes, click `Edit`, update the parameters, and regenerate the plan.

3. Once satisfied, click `Approve` to launch the infrastructure.

4. Add a description if needed and click `Merge` to finalize.

### Launch the Infrastructure

1. The infrastructure creation process will begin. 

   <Callout type="info">
   This process may take some time. Please be patient.
   </Callout>

2. Once the status shows **Success**, your VPC has been successfully created.

---

### Verify the Infrastructure

1. Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2. Confirm that the VPC has been created successfully.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting and Relaunching

   If the infrastructure creation fails, view the logs to identify the issue. Correct any errors in the input values, then relaunch the infrastructure.
