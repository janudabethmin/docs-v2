# Application Security

This section provides vulnerability information of the application. You can view the vulnerabilities, and security reports of the application.

## Code Quality

In every application that has a source code, SkyU automatically runs a code quality check on the source code. The code quality check is done using Semgrep. You can learn more about Semgrep [here](https://github.com/semgrep/semgrep). 

The code quality check provides information on the code quality, security, and maintainability of the source code.

**Explain with AI** functionality enables you to let the AI analyze the code quality report and provide you with the most probable root cause of the issue.
