# Application Logs

In the Logs section of an application, AWS CloudWatch logs for Kubernetes and Lambda-based applications are displayed, offering visibility into the application's operation and helping with troubleshooting and performance monitoring.

The Application Logs page provides the following information:

- **Overview**: In the Overview tab, logs are displayed and can be filtered based on several criteria, such as time period and pod (for Kubernetes-related applications).
- **Settings**: In the Settings tab, you can configure the log group. The default settings are aligned with AWS CloudWatch defaults, but you have the flexibility to edit the log group as needed.
