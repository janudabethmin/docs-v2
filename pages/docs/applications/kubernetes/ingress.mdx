# Ingress

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

## Prerequisites

Before you create an Ingress, you need to have the following:

- An installed Ingress Controller in your cluster. SkyU supports NGINX and Traefik Ingress Controllers. You can install the Ingress Controller by following the instructions in the [Ingress Controller](/docs/helm/curated-charts/nginx-ingress) section.
- DNS records for the domain you want to use for the Ingress. You can register a wildcard or a DNS in SkyU Clusters. Read more in  [Cluster DNS](/docs/clusters/cluster-dns) section.
- Cert Manager installed in your cluster if you want to use cert-manager certificates. You can install cert-manager by following the instructions in the [Cert Manager](/docs/helm/curated-charts/cert-manager) section.

## Create Ingress

You can create an Ingress by clicking on the `Create Ingress` button under specific `Kubernetes` environment inside an application in the SkyU Console.

### Metadata Details

In the metadata section, you can provide the following details:

| Field       | Description                                                                                                    | Example        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Name        | Name of the Ingress. This has to be unique across your organization and should not contain special characters. | test-ingress   |
| Namespace   | Select the namespace where the Ingress should be created.                                                      | default        |
| Cluster     | Select the cluster where the Ingress should be created.                                                        | docker-desktop |
| Annotations | Add annotations to the Ingress. This is used for adding metadata to the Ingress.                               |                |


#### Annotations

Annotations are key-value pairs that can be used to specify non-identifying metadata about objects. They can be used to store information that is not part of the object definition.


Skyu supports the following annotations for Ingress:

- `skyu.io/ingress.cert` : This annotation is used to specify the certificate for the Ingress. These are the expected values for the annotation:
  - `private` : This annotation is used to specify that the Ingress should be secured with a custom certificate user has manually made.
  - `cert-manager` : This annotation is used to specify that the Ingress should be secured with a cert-manager certificate. If this is chosen, the user should provide the cert-manager issuer name in the `skyu.io/ingress.cert.issuer` annotation.
  - `none` : This annotation is used to specify that the Ingress should not be secured with a certificate.
-  `skyu.io/ingress.provider` : This annotation is used to specify the Ingress provider. These are the expected values for the annotation:
  - `nginx` : This annotation is used to specify that the Ingress should be created with the NGINX Ingress Controller.
  - `traefik` : This annotation is used to specify that the Ingress should be created with the Traefik Ingress Controller.


You can add any additional ingress annotations in the `Annotations` field.

### Hosts and Paths

In the `Hosts and Paths` section, you can provide the following details:

| Field        | Description                                                                                                            | Example  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Select DNS   | You can register a wildcard or a DNS in SkyU Clusters. Read more in  [Cluster DNS](/docs/clusters/cluster-dns) section |          |
| Host         | The host name of the Ingress. This is the domain name that the Ingress will route traffic to.                          | test.com |
| Path         | The path of the Ingress. This is the path that the Ingress will route traffic to.                                      | /        |
| Service Port | The port of the service that the Ingress will route traffic to.                                                        | 80       |


### TLS

If you enable TLS, provide the secret name that contains the certificate and key for the Ingress. The secret must be created in the same namespace as the Ingress.

If you are using cert-manager, you don't  need to create a secret manually. Cert-manager will create the secret for you. Just give a name for the secret
