# Kubernetes Spec

This section provides the kubernetes configuration of the application. You can view the kubernetes configuration of the application and change the configurations per environment.

You can read more about the SkyU Kubernetes Spec in [Kustomize Transformer](/docs/concepts/kustomize-transformer) section.



## Containers

The containers section provides the container configurations of the application. This is configured for you at the creation of the application automatically. However, you can add more containers to your application depending on your requirements.

<Image src="/assets/images/applications/container-view.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500}  />

The Slider enables you to update the resources allocated to the container. You can update the CPU and Memory allocated to the container by sliding the slider.
Left corner of the slider gives `Request` value and right corner gives `Limit` value.


Following is the container configuration of the application.

<Steps>

### Container Details

1. Click on the `Create Container` button.
2. Fill out the container details.


| Field                      | Description                                                                                                                                                  | Example |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Name                       | Name of the Container. This has to be unique across your application and should not contain special characters.                                              | busybox |
| Image Pull Policy          | `Always` would pull the image always when a pod starts up. `IfNotPresent` will only pull the image if it is not available in the kubernetes node             | Always  |
| Image Registry URL         | The URL of the image registry where the image is stored.                                                                                                     | busybox |
| Tag                        | The tag of the image. This is the version of the image that will be used to create the container.                                                            | latest  |
| Image Registry Credentials | The credentials to access the image registry. If it's not a public image please refer [Integrations](/docs/integrations/docker-registry) to add a credential | public  |

### Resource Allocation

You can allocate resources to the container by specifying the limits and requests for the container. This will ensure that the container does not consume more resources than allocated.

| Field          | Description                                                                  | Example |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| CPU Request    | The amount of CPU allocated to the container. This is in millicores.         | 100m    |
| Memory Request | The amount of memory allocated to the container. This is in bytes.           | 100Mi   |
| CPU Limit      | The maximum amount of CPU that the container can use. This is in millicores. | 100m    |
| Memory Limit   | The maximum amount of memory that the container can use. This is in bytes.   | 100Mi   |


<Image src="/assets/images/applications/container-resources.png" alt="Hello" width={1000} height={500}  />

You can `disable` limits for the container by toggling the switch. This will allow the container to use the resources as needed.

<Callout type="info">
Be mindful when  having a huge difference between the request and limit values. This can lead to performance issues in the cluster. Generally, the request value should be equal to the limit value or about 20% less than the limit value.
</Callout>

### Port Specification

You can specify the ports that the container will listen on. This is useful when you want to expose the container to the outside world.

| Field        | Description                                                                 | Example |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Port         | The port number that the container will listen on. This is a numeric value. | 80      |
| Service port | The port number that the service will listen on. This is a numeric value.   | 80      |
| Protocol     | The protocol that the port will use. This can be either TCP or UDP.         | TCP     |

<Callout type="info">
Ideally Port and Service port should be the same. However, you can specify different ports if needed.
</Callout>

### Command and Arguments

You can specify the command and arguments that the container will run when it starts up. This is useful when you want to run a specific command when the container starts.

- ***Command***: The command that the container will run when it starts up. This is a string value. This will override the default command defined in the Dockerfile.
- ***Arguments***: The arguments that the command will use when it runs. This is a string value. This will override the default arguments defined in the Dockerfile.

<Callout type="info">
If your dockerfile has an `ENTRYPOINT` defined, only the arguments will be overridden. If the dockerfile has a `CMD` defined, the command and arguments will be overridden.
</Callout>

</Steps>


## Health Checks

Health checks are used to determine the health of the container. This is useful when you want to ensure that the container is running as expected.

There are three types of health checks that you can configure for the container.

- ***Liveness Probe***: This is used to determine if the container is running. If the liveness probe fails, the container will be restarted.
- ***Readiness Probe***: This is used to determine if the container is ready to accept traffic. If the readiness probe fails, the container will not receive traffic.
- ***Startup Probe***: This is used to determine if the container is ready to accept traffic. If the startup probe fails, the container will not receive traffic. This is used to delay the readiness probe until the container is ready to accept traffic.

In SkyU, you can put the same configuration for all 3 at once or create seperate configurations for each.

The following are the configurations for the health checks.

<Steps>

### General Details

Select the container for which you want to configure the probe and select the types of probes you want to configure.

<Image src="/assets/images/applications/container-health.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500}  />

### Configure Probe

You can configure how the probe will check the health of the container in this section.

You have the following options to configure the probe.

#### HTTP GET Request

This is used to determine the health of the container by making an HTTP request to the container. This only supports `GET` requests.

| Field        | Description                                                              | Example |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Path         | The path that the probe will request. This is a string value.            | /health |
| Port         | The port that the probe will request. This is a numeric value.           | 80      |
| HTTP Headers | The headers that the probe will send. This is a list of key-value pairs. |         |

#### TCP Socket

This is used to determine the health of the container by making a TCP connection to the container.

| Field | Description                                                    | Example |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Port  | The port that the probe will request. This is a numeric value. | 80      |


#### Command

This is used to determine the health of the container by running a command inside the container.


#### Configure Frequency

You can configure how often the probe will check the health of the container in this section.



| Field             | Description                                                                | Example |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Initial Delay     | The amount of time to wait before starting the probe. This is in seconds.  | 10      |
| Timeout           | The amount of time to wait for the probe to complete. This is in seconds.  | 5       |
| Period            | The amount of time to wait between probes. This is in seconds.             | 15      |
| Success Threshold | The number of successful probes required to mark the container as healthy. | 1       |
| Failure Threshold | The number of failed probes required to mark the container as unhealthy.   | 3       |

<Image src="/assets/images/applications/container-health-frequency.png" alt="Hello" width={500} height={500}  />

<Callout type="info">
If your container goes into a crashloop, or health check starts failing you can increase the `Initial Delay` to give the container more time to start up before the probe starts.
</Callout>
</Steps>


## Scaling

SkyU supports Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale the application based on the resource utilization. You can configure the HPA for the application in the scaling section.

<Image src="/assets/images/applications/container-scaling.png" alt="Hello" width={1000} height={500}  />

If you want to scale the application based on the resource utilization, you can configure the following fields.

| Field           | Description                                                               | Example |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| Min Replicas    | The minimum number of replicas that the application will have.            | 1       |
| Max Replicas    | The maximum number of replicas that the application will have.            | 10      |
| CPU Utilization | The target CPU utilization percentage that the application will scale on. | 80%     |
| Memory Usage    | The target Memory Usage the application will scale on.                    | 500Mi   |


<Callout type="info">
If you simply want to increase the number of replicas without any scaling, you can do so by updating the min and max number to be the same under scaling.
</Callout>


## Service Account

You can configure the service account for the application in the service account section. This is useful when you want to give the application specific permissions in the cluster.

Refer to the [Service Account](/docs/environments/service-accounts) section for more information on service accounts.
