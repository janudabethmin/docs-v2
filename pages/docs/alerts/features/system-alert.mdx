# Alerts Routing

Alerts Routing allows you to control how alerts are directed to specific target groups based on criteria such as alert severity or specific labels. This feature ensures that the right teams or individuals are notified about relevant alerts, enabling quicker and more effective responses. By setting up alert routing, you can ensure alerts are sent to the appropriate target groups based on the conditions you specify.

### View Alerts Routes

Navigate to the `Alerts` section in the SkyU Console on the left-hand side menu. Navigate to `Alerts Routing` to view all existing alerts routes.

An individual alert route has the following key fields:

- **Labels**: Alerts contain labels that provide context or categorization. In this field, if the defined labels match those in an alert, the alert will be selected and routed to the specified channel.
  <Callout type="info">
    Please note that in addition to the labels defined in the alerts, you can
    also use the following labels for routing:
    <br />- `environment`: Environment name (e.g., `prod`, `staging`, `dev`).
  </Callout>
- **Repeat Alerts**: This setting controls whether repeated alerts will trigger notifications. If an alert repeats after a certain period (e.g., 12 hours in Prometheus, which can be adjusted in the configuration), enabling this switch will send notifications for the repeated alerts. If you only want to receive notifications when an alert is first triggered, and not for subsequent repetitions, turn off this switch.
- **Enable/Disable Alerts**: This setting determines whether notifications will be sent to the channel. If you want to temporarily stop receiving notifications, you can disable this option, and no alerts will be sent to that channel until it is enabled again.
- **Target Groups**: These are the groups you want to notify when alerts meet the specified conditions.
- **Specify Email Recipients**: In addition to notifying the target group, you can specify email addresses here to send alert notifications directly to specific recipients.
