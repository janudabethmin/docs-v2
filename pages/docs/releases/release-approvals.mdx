# Release Approvals

When creating a release, SkyU provides the functionality to optionally add approvers to the release.
Once approvers are added and the release is created, the deployment will not occur automatically and will require manual deployment after approval.

- **`Partial Approval`**: The release will be approved when at least one person on the approvers list approves it.
- **`Approval`**: Every person in the approval request must approve the release before it can be deployed.

Approvals requested by the user and approvals created by the user can be found in the `Approvals` tab.
Additionally, the SkyU system will send an email notification to the approvers when they are added to a release.
