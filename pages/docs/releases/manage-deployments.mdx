# Manage Deployments

After creating a release, all releases will be listed under the release history.  
If each application passes the `CI` process successfully, the deployment will be done automatically.

The release status can be one of the following:

- **`PENDING`**: The release is still pending. Application CI pipelines are still in progress.
- **`SUCCESS`**: Deployment successful. All applications were deployed successfully.  
  Applications that successfully passed the CI run will be deployed.
- **`PARTIAL_SUCCESS`**: Not all applications were deployed.
- **`FAILED`**: The release failed.
- **`DEPLOYMENT_READY`**: The release was successful, but not all pipelines were successful. Deployment can be triggered manually for the applications that succeeded.
- **`APPROVAL_PENDING`**: Awaiting approval for deployment.
- **`APPROVAL_APPROVED`**: The release has been approved for deployment.
- **`APPROVAL_DENIED`**: The release has been denied.

<Callout type="info">
  While releases with the status **`SUCCESS`** and **`PARTIAL_SUCCESS`** can be
  re-deployed manually, releases with the status **`DEPLOYMENT_READY`** and
  **`APPROVAL_APPROVED`** should be deployed manually after the release.
