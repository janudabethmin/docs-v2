# "Bean & Brew" Coffee Shop

Consider a project named "Bean & Brew," which includes a website and services for user authentication, orders, carts, and catalogues.
With Project Releases, all these components can be managed and deployed together across various environments ( i.e. development, staging, production), ensuring that each service is up-to-date and functioning correctly.

## Handling Deployment Challenges

- **Tracking Application Updates:** SkyU compares commit SHAs to identify and highlight applications that are not up-to-date, providing visual indicators for quick assessment.

- **Bulk Deployment:** Allows for the promotion of multiple applications simultaneously, giving release managers control over deploying all or selected applications at once.

- **Deployment Verification:** Visually confirms the success of each application's deployment within the SkyU console, ensuring that all promoted applications have been successfully deployed.

- **Failure Management:** In the event of a deployment failure, the system provides detailed logs to identify the cause, and offers options to proceed with other deployments or address the issue before continuing.

- **Rollback Capability:** Enables quick rollback to previous stable versions if issues are detected post-deployment, maintaining system stability and reliability.

By integrating the Project Releases feature, SkyU enhances the deployment experience, making it more predictable, efficient, and aligned with modern DevOps practices.
