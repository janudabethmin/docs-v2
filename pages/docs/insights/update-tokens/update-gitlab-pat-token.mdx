# Steps to update the GitLab PAT token in DevLake

#### 1. Verify the current PAT token connectivity.

- Navigate to the Insights tab in the left sidebar of the SkyU Console.
- Click **Settings** sidebar item.
- If GitLab apps are linked to your projects, they'll appear under the GitLab tab.
- You'll see the configured organization/user name, the added apps, and any custom apps for insights configurations.
- If the organization/user isnâ€™t configured, a **Configure GitLab** button will be visible in the row.
