- If Bitbucket apps are linked to your projects, they'll appear under the Bitbucket tab.
- You'll see the configured organization/workspace name, the added apps, and any custom apps for insights configurations.
- If the organization/workspace isnâ€™t configured, a **Configure Bitbucket** button will be visible in the row.
- Follow the [Configure Bitbucket insights](/docs/insights/bitbucket-configuration) guide to set up Bitbucket applications.
