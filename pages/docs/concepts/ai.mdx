# Artificial Intelligence

SkyU has a number of AI features which are designed to help you run and debug your workloads. These features are integrated with OpenAI's GPT-4 and other AI models to provide you with the best possible experience.

You can bring in your own OpenAI API key or use the default key provided by SkyU.

## Connecting your OpenAI API Key

More information on how to connect your OpenAI API is available under [Connect OpenAPI](/docs/integrations/chatgpt) section.

## Run Private Hosted AI Models

SkyU allows you to run your own AI models in a private hosted environment. Which can be plugged into the SkyU AI features instead of using the default OpenAI API.

This will ensure that your data is secure and not shared with any third-party services.
