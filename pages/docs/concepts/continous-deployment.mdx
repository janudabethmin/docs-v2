# Continuous Deployment

SkyU supports Continuous Deployment (CD) to automate the deployment process of your applications. Continuous Deployment is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production environments. This practice allows developers to release code changes more frequently and with less manual intervention.

SkyU CD pipelines are integrated with Github Actions and a Custom Job Runner in Kubernetes.

<Callout type="info">
SkyU CD Job Runner is purely for Kubernetes Deployments only. For other types of deployments, Github Actions are automatically generated and triggered by SkyU.

## Kubernetes Deployments with SkyU

Github Actions are automatically generated and triggered by SkyU for Kubernetes Deployments. Github Action then triggers the SkyU Job Runner to deploy the application to the Kubernetes Cluster.

SkyU Job Runner would generate the yamls using Kustomize and apply them to the Kubernetes Cluster.

You can learn more about Kustomize usage and File Merging in the [Gitops](/docs/concepts/gitops) section.
