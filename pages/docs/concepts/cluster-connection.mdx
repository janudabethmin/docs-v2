# Cluster Connection

SkyU Console allows you to connect to an existing Kubernetes Cluster. This works by installing the SkyU Agent on the Kubernetes Cluster. The SkyU Agent is a lightweight agent that runs on the Kubernetes Cluster and communicates with the SkyU Console. The agent is responsible for syncing the Kubernetes Cluster state with the SkyU Console.

Agent establishes a secure connection with the SkyU Console using a secure token. The token is generated by the SkyU Console and is unique to each Kubernetes Cluster. The token is used to authenticate the agent with the SkyU Console.

The Cluster can be completely private and Agent only requires an `outbound 443` connection to the SkyU Console. The agent does not require any inbound connections to the Kubernetes Cluster.

<Callout type="info">
All Agent to SkyU Console communication is encrypted using TLS. In addition, the data itself is encrypted using a secure key unique to each Kubernetes Cluster.
</Callout>
